The EaseFilter SDK offers a range of features for file security:
	File Monitoring and Audit: Real-time tracking of file system I/O activities. You can know who accessed your files and when.
	File Access Control: Control file access to prevent unauthorized users or processes from reaching sensitive files.
	Transparent File Encryption: Encrypt data on-the-fly, supporting AES-256 military-grade encryption.
	Secure File Sharing with DRM: Share encrypted files with embedded digital rights management. You can grant or revoke access anytime.
	Registry Monitoring and Protection: Prevent unauthorized changes to the Windows registry.
	Process Monitoring and Protection: Keep an eye on process creation and termination to prevent untrusted programs from launching.
	Secure Sandbox: Safely run untrusted programs with restrictions.
	Storage Tiering Solution: Automatically move data between local stub files and cloud storage for efficient archiving.
EaseFilter’s SDK can be customized to meet specific requirements, and they even offer consulting services and source code for creating your own filter driver1.

FileMonitor - Unit Tests (FileMonitor.exe)
------------------

File Monitor Demo was developed with EaseFilter File Monitor Filter Driver SDK, it demonstrates how to use the EaseFilter File Monitor SDK to monitor the Windows file I/O. 
The FileMonitor demo tool can monitor the file change and file access in real time, get the notification for all the registered file I/O requests. 
It can capture the file open, file creation, file change, file read, file written, query file information, set file information, query security information, 
set security information, file rename, file delete, directory browsing and file close I/O requests. 
You can log the file I/O information to know who, when, what files were accessed. Here is the FileMonitor demo tool screenshot.

FileMonitor IO Registration Unit Test
	1. Register the POST_CREATE and POST_SET_INFORMATION.
	2. The callback function will get the notification after the file was opened or file information was changed.

	Test file open event passed.
	The OnFileOpen event was invoked.
	Test file size change event passed.
	The OnFileSetFileSize event was invoked.

Monitor File IO Events Unit Test.
	Register the monitor file IO events: create,rename,delete,written,file info changed, read, security change in the test folder.

	Test new file creation event passed.
	A test file was created.
	Test file info change event passed.
	The test file's attributes were changed.
	Test file read event passed.
	The test file's data was read.
	Test file rename event passed.
	The test file was renamed.
	Test file security change event passed.
	The test file's security was changed.
	Test file written event passed.
	The test file was written.
	Test file delete event passed.
	The test file was deleted.

Process Filter - Unit Tests (ProcessMon.exe)
------------------

Overview of Process Monitor Capabilities
	Process Monitor includes powerful monitoring and filtering capabilities, including:
		More data captured for operation input and output parameters
		Non-destructive filters allow you to set filters without losing data
		Capture of thread stacks for each operation make it possible in many cases to identify the root cause of an operation
		Reliable capture of process details, including image path, command line, user and session ID
		Configurable and moveable columns for any event property
		Filters can be set for any data field, including fields not configured as columns
		Advanced logging architecture scales to tens of millions of captured events and gigabytes of log data
		Process tree tool shows relationship of all processes referenced in a trace
		Native log format preserves all data for loading in a different Process Monitor instance
		Process tooltip for easy viewing of process image information
		Detail tooltip allows convenient access to formatted data that doesn’t fit in the column
		Cancellable search
		Boot time logging of all operations

Process Filter Driver Unit Test.
	DENY_NEW_PROCESS_CREATION control flag test passed.
	File access control flag ALLOW_OPEN_WITH_CREATE_OR_OVERWRITE_ACCESS test for current process passed
	PROCESS_CREATION_NOTIFICATION control flag test passed.
	Register control IO callback for current process test passed.
	Register monitor IO callback for current process test passed.
