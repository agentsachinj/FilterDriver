The EaseFilter SDK offers a range of features for file security:
	File Monitoring and Audit: Real-time tracking of file system I/O activities. You can know who accessed your files and when.
	File Access Control: Control file access to prevent unauthorized users or processes from reaching sensitive files.
	Transparent File Encryption: Encrypt data on-the-fly, supporting AES-256 military-grade encryption.
	Secure File Sharing with DRM: Share encrypted files with embedded digital rights management. You can grant or revoke access anytime.
	Registry Monitoring and Protection: Prevent unauthorized changes to the Windows registry.
	Process Monitoring and Protection: Keep an eye on process creation and termination to prevent untrusted programs from launching.
	Secure Sandbox: Safely run untrusted programs with restrictions.

FileMonitor - Unit Tests (FileMonitor.exe)
------------------

File Monitor Demo was developed with EaseFilter File Monitor Filter Driver SDK, it demonstrates how to use the EaseFilter File Monitor SDK to monitor the Windows file I/O. 
The FileMonitor demo tool can monitor the file change and file access in real time, get the notification for all the registered file I/O requests. 
It can capture the file open, file creation, file change, file read, file written, query file information, set file information, query security information, 
set security information, file rename, file delete, directory browsing and file close I/O requests. 
You can log the file I/O information to know who, when, what files were accessed. Here is the FileMonitor demo tool screenshot.

Overview of Process Monitor Capabilities
	Process Monitor includes powerful monitoring and filtering capabilities, including:
		More data captured for operation input and output parameters
		Non-destructive filters allow you to set filters without losing data
		Capture of thread stacks for each operation make it possible in many cases to identify the root cause of an operation
		Reliable capture of process details, including image path, command line, user and session ID
		Configurable and moveable columns for any event property
		Filters can be set for any data field, including fields not configured as columns
		Advanced logging architecture scales to tens of millions of captured events and gigabytes of log data
		Process tree tool shows relationship of all processes referenced in a trace
		Native log format preserves all data for loading in a different Process Monitor instance
		Process tooltip for easy viewing of process image information
		Detail tooltip allows convenient access to formatted data that doesn’t fit in the column
		Cancellable search
		Boot time logging of all operations

File Security (?)
------------------
File Monitor/File Audit – Track file change on the fly
	File system monitor filter can monitor the file system activities on the fly. 	With file system monitor filter you can monitor the file activities on file system level, 
	capture file open, create, overwrite, read, write, query file information, 	set file information, query security information, set security information, file rename, 
	file delete, directory browsing and file close I/O requests. You can develop the software for the following purposes:
		Create your own Continuous data protection (CDP) software to log the file update information, write information with offset and length in real time.
		Audit your file content. You can intercept any file system call, analyze it content, log it.
		Create Access Log, you will know who, when, what files were accessed.
		Journal the file update information. This control may be based on any file parameters, such as its location, type, size, etc.

File Protector – Prevent your sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized users or processes
	File system control filter can control the file activities, which you can intercept the file system call, modify its content before or after the request goes down 
	to the file system, allow/deny/cancel its execution based on the filter rule. You can fully control file open/create/overwrite, read/write, query/set file attribute/size/time 
	security information, rename/delete, directory browsing these Io requests. With file system control filter you can developer these kinds of software:
		Create your Data protection Software. Block accessing your data based on your security policy, prevent data modification without permission.
		Create your own encryption software via encrypt the write data and decrypt the read data.
		Create your own custom security policies to control the file access.
		Hide or replace the files in the directory. You can modify the directory buffer to hide some files or change file name.

File Encryption At Rest – Transparent on-access, file level encryption
	EaseFilter File system encryption filter driver SDK provides you  a comprehensive security solution to develop the transparent encryption products which it can encrypt or 
	decrypt files on-the-fly, it can allow only authorized users or processes to access the encrypted files.
		Supported strong cryptographic algorithm Rijndael is a high security algorithm which was chosen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the new 
		Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), it can support key length 128-bits,192-bits and 256-bits.

Secure File Sharing – Control share file access with digital rights embedded
	Encrypt the file with 256-bits key, embedded with the digital rights management protection, only the authorized users, processes and computers can access the encrypted file. 
	Share your files with fully control, you can expire or revoke the file access at any time, even after the file has been shared. Add or remove the authorized users, processes 
	and computers at any time.

Registry access monitoring and protection
	Monitoring registry calls to track the registry changes. When the registry key, value or security was modified, the callback routine will be invoked with a data structure that 
	contains information that is specific to the type of registry operation.
		Blocking registry calls to prevent your registry from being changed by unauthorized processes. When the registry key, value or security is going to be modified, 
		the callback routine will be invoked with a data structure that contains information that is specific to the type of registry operation, 
		If a RegistryCallback routine returns a status value “STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED” for a pre-notification, this registry operation will be blocked and the error code will be returned.

Process access monitoring and protection
	Monitoring the process and thread creation or termination, get the notification of the process and thread operations when you register the events. Prevent the untrusted 
	executable binaries ( malwares) from being launched, protect your data being damaged by the untrusted processes.

Secure Sandbox Solution
	A sandbox is a secure, isolated and a tightly controlled environment where programs can be run and data can be protected. Sandboxes restrict what a piece of code can do, 
	giving it just as many, permissions as it needs without adding additional permissions that could be abused. Prevent malicious or malfunctioning programs from running. 
	Run untrusted Windows programs safely in Easefilter Secure Sandbox. Protect your confidential files in Easefilter Secure Sandbox.
